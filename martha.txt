I will sleep when I die
wait till your father gets home
more then a mouthful is waisted
We are all the same height lying down
Love you more
Plenty-nine
Flaunt them if you got them
Knockers up
If you like it buy it in every color
Don’t waist the film
Take a picture take a picture 
Go play on the freeway
Lipstick lipstick 
Call me when you get home
A pinch or a handful
You don’t need more than a mouthful
